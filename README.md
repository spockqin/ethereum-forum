# ethereum-forum
A forum managed by a smart contract deployed on Ethereum Ropsten test blockchain

The ability to interact with the forum is granted to those who deposit ether in the smart contract, 
which manages registration and access directory. 

A centralized server is only responsible for front-end and forum content.

The goal is to create an incentivization system in which the creators and supporters of popular posts
will receive financial rewards automatically processed by the smart contract excluding human intervention.

Run "meteor add ethereum:web3" and then "meteor" to start the project.
