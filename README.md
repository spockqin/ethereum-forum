# ethereum-forum
A forum that interacts with Ethereum public test blockchain

The ability to interact with the forum is granted to those who deposit ether in the smart contract, 
which manages registration and access directory. 

A centralized server only manages front-end and forum content.

The goal is to create an incentivization system in which the creators and supporters of popular posts
will receive financial rewards automatically processed by the smart contract excluding human intervention.
